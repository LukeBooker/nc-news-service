## Start note to new developer

As .env.\* is added to the .gitignore, when cloning this repo you need to create two .env files for the project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
